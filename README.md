# Automod_Project
These are the projects from ISE-5264 Semiconductor Manufacturing course which mainly focus on learning of the basics of applying a simulation modelling technique to a real world semiconductor manufacturing Process which uses Automated Material Handling Systems(AMHS), where efficient coordination between the machines and material handling systems is critical.



In this Assignments and projects we mainly focused on Layout designs (Segregating Inter/Intra Bay models), Machine Failures, Stochasticity, Job loading and Sequencing, handling multiple products, Set-Up time and lots



**Assignment 1** - It involves designing layouts using AutoMod, managing machine failures, and analyzing stochastic variability. Students explore aspects such as resource utilization, bottlenecks, and the impact of variability in parameters like machine uptime/downtime and processing times on production efficiency, particularly focusing on minimizing makespan.



**Project phase 1** objective is to develop a simulation model using AutoMod to analyze the performance of a wafer fabrication facility. The wafer fab layout and no of tools already provided in the project report. The focus is on calculating the average cycle time, which represents the total time each lot spends in the system, including processing and waiting times and trying to find the best loading sequence of the products to get better cycle time



**Assignment 2** This assignment explores job loading and sequencing strategies in a wafer fabrication system using simulation techniques. It involves analyzing key performance metrics like makespan, cycle time, and throughput under different job release policies and sequencing rules. Job Prioritization Using FIFO (First In, First Out) and SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time) scheduling rules. Job Release Policies Evaluating CONWIP (Constant Work-in-Progress) levels. Manage multiple wafer types (e.g., A and B) with different processing requirements and sequencing orders. **Lot Processing** Studying the impact of varying lot sizes and setup times on performance and Optimizing lot sizes to minimize cycle times and makespan.


**Project Phase 2**The goal is to develop an AutoMod simulation model for the front-end semiconductor manufacturing process to evaluate and optimize operational policies for improved system performance. The focus is on minimizing cycle time through the analysis of different job loading and dispatching rules, including CONWIP-based job loading.
