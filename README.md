# Automod_Project
These are the projects from ISE-5264 Semiconductor Manufacturing course which mainly focus on learning of the basics of applying a simulation modelling technique to a real world semiconductor manufacturing Process which uses Automated Material Handling Systems(AMHS), where efficient coordination between the machines and material handling systems is critical.
In this Assignments and projects we mainly focused on Layout designs (Segregating Inter/Intra Bay models), Machine Failures, Stochasticity, Job loading and Sequencing, handling multiple products, Set-Up time and lots
